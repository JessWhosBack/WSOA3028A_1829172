                <h1>
                    A Brief History of <b><i>Me</i></b>
                </h1>

                <p>
                    My story began a long time ago in the small town of Pretoria (yes it was small back then). I
                    went to the only school in town, and it is on this very school's bus where I first met
                    the love of my life. Fast forward a few years, my parents didn’t have enough money to send me to
                    university, however my father was adamant that I was to learn a trade – “Having a piece of
                    paper with your name on it is nice, but if you have a trade, my boy, then you will always have work”
                    was his philosophy on the subject. So, I went into the trade of instrument making, and for many
                    years I made specialist instruments for all types of people – from doctors, to other craftsmen.

                    As grateful as I am for getting the chance to work and learn such a skill, it become quite
                    repetitive - I had a burning passion to learn something new. I started to look for work elsewhere;
                    it was now that I discovered the second
                    love of my life; teaching. I was fortunate enough to be hired as a part-time lecturer (I had been
                    trained in technical drawing during my trade) by an institute that simultaneously
                    allowed me to complete a mechanical engineering diploma. After this, I studied further in Theology –
                    as I came from a very religious family – as well as Social Studies, however my true passion remained
                    in teaching. It was then that I noticed a great need in my country – there were too many students,
                    coming from previously (or currently at the time) disadvantaged backgrounds that did not possess the
                    skills that the institute assumed they should have that were needed to pass (let alone excel) at the
                    technical drawing course (or any other course that requires 3D visualization skills). I then created
                    my third love – a one-year bridging course for such students, that would allow them to catch up the
                    missing skills in minimal time, and thus further their studies with better pass rates and grades. I
                    headed this program for many years, until being asked to pass it on to another, younger lecturer. I
                    continued to lecture at the institute until retiring only six years ago.

                    It is because of this passion for teaching and learning that I created this website – with the hopes
                    to inspire just one other person to go and read a ‘something’, a ‘anything’.
                    <br>Reading will opens the mind!
