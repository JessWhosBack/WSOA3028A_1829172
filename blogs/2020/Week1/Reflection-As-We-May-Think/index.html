                    Vannevar Bush (1890 – 1974) was an American engineer, scientist and inventor. He headed the Office
                    of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) before and during World War II. The OSRD was
                    responsible for the Manhattan Project. Later in life, he became the vice president of Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology (MIT) and dean of the MIT School of Engineering.

                <h2>My Reflection About the Article</h2>
                <p>
                    Vannevar Bush seemed to be a man who thought that violent and destructive scientific/technological
                    inventions were necessary during the World War(s). However, he also believed that these
                    scientific/technological inventions could and should rather be used to lead towards
                    understanding/research/development etc. One of his primary concerns is that in times of peace,
                    scientists will have no motivation/cause to pursue their profession with the same zeal or commitment
                    as during times of war. Another concern was that, even during his time, there was too much
                    information for any one person to sort through and/or analyse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bush then goes on to suggest – or rather predict – many gadgets/machines of the future; many of
                    which have indeed materialised in some form. The first gadget mentioned in this article is that of a
                    walnut sized camera, positioned on a person’s forehead, used to capture what the wearer sees. This
                    is indeed the basic idea behind many such ‘smart glasses’ today such as <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> by Google or even the comparatively
                    inexpensive <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">Focals</a> by North (coming 2020). Bush made further
                    predictions about photography and film – specifically that the storage of photos will become smaller
                    and immediate – with the ability to store hundreds or even thousands of such photos or book pages
                    etc. in a tiny area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Bush then states that the mass storage of such information means very little if there is no
                    efficient or quick way or organising and the accessing such information. This lead on to arguably
                    his most impressive prediction – the “memex”. He describes this machine as a desk in appearance,
                    that would have the ability to immediately bring any file or material on any subject to the operator
                    via translucent viewing screens that magnify supermicrofilm. It would also allow for the operator to
                    automatically photograph notes, pictures, letters, files, etc. to be stored in the desk for future
                    reference. This invention sounds very much like the modern-day desktop computer – information on a
                    hard drive that is accessed and displayed on screen(s). However, once again Bush goes on to mention
                    that unless the data/information can be linked and analysed, there is not much point to having such
                    vast storage. He then goes on to describe how the “memex” would be able to create permanent trails
                    between any such file/picture/etc. stored within it. This is effectively the equivalent of the
                    hyperlink used throughout the World Wide Web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inventions and predictions made by Bush when this article was written are truly inspirational
                    considering how much technology has indeed advanced since then.
