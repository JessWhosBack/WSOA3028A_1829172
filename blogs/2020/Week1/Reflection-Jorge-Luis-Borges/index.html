                <h2>The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges</h2>
                <p>
                    This short story describes the known and unknown universe in an incredibly unique way. It defines
                    the universe (labelled “the Library”) as an infinite number of small hexagonal ‘galleries’ or rooms
                    which contain bookshelves. Each gallery leads onto another gallery as well as connecting to a spiral
                    staircase which “winds upwards and downwards into the remotest distance” <a href="#ref1"
                        title="The Library of Babel">[1]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The part of this story that I found the most interesting was the reaction that those living in “the
                    Library” had to the announcement that “the Library contained all books” <a href="#ref1"
                        title="The Library of Babel">[1]</a>.
                    Borges writes that:
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                            “…the first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact
                            and secret treasure. There was no personal problem, no world problem, whose eloquent
                            solution did not exist – somewhere in some hexagon. The universe was justified…”
                            <a href="#ref1" title="The Library of Babel">[1]</a>.
                        </i>
                    </blockquote>
                    Immediately after this announcement, thousands of individuals started rushing around, abandoning
                    their own galleries to try and get to more ‘valuable’ galleries first. Others started destroying any
                    books that they deemed to be worthless in their own search of value – leading to the loss of
                    “millions of volumes”. Further, some individuals thought up a “Book-Man” (who is analogous to a god)
                    and spent hundreds of years looking for “Him”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason that I found this so interesting was the fact that this behaviour of the individuals was
                    so very, disappointingly, predictable. It seems that, even in a short story about an infinite
                    book-universe, power – or even just the hope of power – corrupts, always. Unfortunately, it seems
                    that humans are more likely to individually race each other, than try and walk together. More likely
                    to destroy that around them, than dare risk others benefitting from it. More likely to put their
                    trust, hopes and responsibilities in some god, than get up and achieve their dreams themselves.

                <h2>The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges</h2>
                <p>
                    To think that one man, way back when, in 1941, BEFORE the invention of a computer (let alone the
                    world wide web), managed to dream up and accurately describe the hypertext of today (regardless of
                    his use of a fictional story as a medium of explanation), is mind blowing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst reading The Garden of Forking Paths Borges forces our minds to wander around – as if in our
                    own labyrinth – within the story itself, through the use of ‘intertextuality’. He references many
                    different texts; from real documents and stories, to imaginary documents and stories that Borges
                    himself invented. He also has different narrators chime in at different times and even includes an
                    anonymous “manuscript editor”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this doesn’t sound like a prototype of today’s Wikipedia, then I don’t know what does. In The
                    Garden of Forking Paths, many different paths are described and when followed, leading to different
                    destinations – which is arguable the invention of the hypertext novel, and thus the underlying
                    concepts behind the World Wide Web. It is thought by some that Borges was one of the first to ever
                    think and write about what we now know as the internet.
