            <h2>Wireframe Development</h2>
            <h3>User Interface Research and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that the two most important pages in terms of User Interface (UI) of my website is that of:
            <ol>
                <li>My home page</li>
                <li>My blog post main page</li>
            </ol>
            All the other pages of my website will follow the same simple but clean and visually pleasing display. This
            includes having only column of well-structured paragraphs, images, etc. that flow nicely on from one
            another. It is vital that all of these aspects are able to wrap onto new lines and scale appropriately so as
            to provide an equally clean and visually pleasing display when used on a mobile device (phone, tablet,
            phablet, etc.). These pages have been developed over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus of this blog post is to try and decide on a layout for the blog post main page. This page is
                super
                important because it is where the user is exposed to all the various blog posts that I have written. If
                these blog posts are not displayed in a visually pleasing way, then users are not going to click on the
                blog
                posts, which means they are not going to read the blog posts... :(
            </p>
            <p>
                I did a bit of research about the User Experience and User Interface. I really enjoyed and took lots of
                inspiration from the <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/10-essential-ui-design-tips"
                    target="_blank">webflow.com "10 essential UI (user-interface) design tips"</a>, as well as <a
                    href="https://uxdesign.cc/9-simple-tips-to-improve-your-ui-designs-fast-377c5113ac82"
                    target="_blank">uxdesign.cc "9 tips to quickly improve your UI designs"</a>. I have come to the
                conclusion that the following are important to include/think about:
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure expectations are always made clear. Examples include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Highlighting buttons</li>
                    <li>Using the corresponding cursor for all parts of the page</li>
                    <li>Using appropriate colours (i.e. don't use green for stop/bad/no)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Anticipate user's mistakes:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prevent the mistakes as much as possible</li>
                    <li>Provide ways to easily fix any mistakes after they happen</li>
                    <li>Make sure your error messages are crystal clear</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Feedback feedback feedback!!!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast loading times</li>
                    <li>If that can't happen, display a visualization that makes the loading time less boring</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            But perhaps don't use an actual loading bar... as this might make the loading time seem
                            longer, therefore use a visualization that doesn't imply progress.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>The closer and/or bigger something is, the faster you can put our cursor/finger on it</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make buttons and icons big enough to easily see and click</li>
                    <li>Make buttons for the most common actions larger and more prominent</li>
                    <li>Place commonly interacted with elemtns on the edges/corners of the screen so that it lessens the
                        need for accuracy (i.e. a user doesn't need to worry about overshooting when clicking/tapping)
                    </li>
                    <li>Horizontal scrolling is unusual... and therefore needs big and obvious cues for the user to be
                        able to predict and use it without confusion
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Stick to standards!!!</li>
                <li>Make sure all elements are clear and well defined</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A "cheat" is to use drop shadows or a super subtle border to make elements appear sharper</li>
                    <li>NB: Shadows must all come from one light source!!!</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Use nice big fonts, especially for long-form content</li>
                <li>If there is a "tutorial" experience - allow users to skip it!</li>
                <li>Use subtle overlays (usually just a black transparent colour) to improve the contrast between the
                    any text that is on top of another image</li>
                <li>White space is your friend!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Playing Around in CSS: Box Shadow Styles</h2>
            The below example of box shadow styles was learnt off the <a
                href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/box-shadow/" target="_blank">
                tympanus.net</a> website. It was also found that Opera Mini does not support this box-shadow property,
            as well as Internet Explorer Version 8.0 and earlier.
