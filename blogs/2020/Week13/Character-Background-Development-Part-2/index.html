        <h2>Technical Drawing Inspiration</h2>
        <h3>Character's Education</h3>
        <p>
            After finishing high school, Eddie's family did not have enough money to send him to a university. However
            his father was adamant that he was to learn a trade. Eddie went into the trade of small instrument making,
            and for many years he made specialist instruments for all types of people - from doctors, to other
            craftsmen.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as grateful as Eddie was for getting the chance to work and learn such a skill, it quickly became
            quite repetitive. Eddie always had a great passion of learning and teaching, and so he started to look for
            work elsewhere. Eddie was then fortunate enough to be hired as a part-time lecturer (as he had been trained
            in technical drawing during his trade) by an institute that simultaneously allowed him to complete a
            mechanical engineering diploma. After this, Eddie studied further in Theology – as his family was (is?) very
            religious - as well as Social Studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was at this point that Eddie noticed a great need in his city and in his country as a whole - there were
            too many students, coming from previously (or currently) disadvantaged backgrounds that did not possess the
            skills that the institute assumed that they had already - and these skills were required in order to simply
            pass (let alone excel) at the technical drawing course (or any other course that requires 3D visualization
            skills). This inspired Eddie to create a one-year bridging course for such students, that would allow them
            to catch up the missing skills in minimal time, and thus further their studies with better pass rates and
            grades. Eddie headed this program for many years, and continued to lecture at the institute until retiring
            only six years ago. Eddie wrote the book "Introduction to Engineering Graphics" which was used extensively
            as the course material for many years (perhaps is still used today... it's still in the Wits University
            Press at the very least).

        <h3>The Inspiration Drawn from this</h3>
        <p>
            Since my (Jesse's) character is based off my own grandfather (Errol van der Merwe), and he actually did
            write "Introduction to Engineering Graphics", I decided that this would be great inspiration for my website.
            I thus dedicated an entire day (pfft... totally not procrastinating other work) to draw images in an
            attempted "technical drawing" style. Since I have no actual technical drawing training, and didn't have time
            to read my grandfather's book, I just used my trusty Typo note pad and lots of pencil lines. I am quite
            happy with the result.

        <p>
            This was done to try and further incorporate my character into his own website - hopefully by using this
            'style' it further propagates the idea that he, himself, drew the images. I am particularly proud of Kermit,
            not gonna lie.

                A very important aspect that I wish to focus on in the future, is the fact that Eddie not only resides
                in Johannesburg, but is also <b>proudly</b> South African. He is fiercely passionate about everything he
                does, and loves to share this knowledge through teaching.

                His family is his life - and his wife is his everything. I would like to make this <b>much</b> more
                apparent in this website.
