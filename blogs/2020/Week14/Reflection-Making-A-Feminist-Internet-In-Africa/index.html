            <h2>Summary of the Editorial</h2>
            <p>
                In the editorial <a
                    href="https://www.genderit.org/editorial/making-feminist-internet-africa-why-internet-needs-african-feminists-and-feminisms"
                    target="_blank">Making a Feminist Internet In Africa: Why the Internet Needs African Feminists and
                    Feminisms</a> by Sheena Magenya, Sheena presents a current and very real problem of today:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                With many gatherings and meetings being cancelled and postponed, the quick and easy solution that is
                being shared around is “well then, let’s just meet online”, and therein lies the problem: presenting the
                internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of communication silver bullet that imagines an
                equality of access, use and representation on the internet which is false. <a href="#ref1"
                    title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The sad reality is that much of this 'online space' that we have been thrust in, especially due to the
                recent pandemic, does not have immediate offline processes and recourse for many terrible behaviours.
                The main and topical example includes that of online gender-based violence. In many first world
                countries there are repercussions for such behaviours in the online environment, but the reality is that
                many African countries are missing such online legislations, guidelines and rules. The online
                environment should be a safe space in which any person from any background, culture, colour, sexuality,
                gender, etc. etc. etc. should be able to express themselves freely and to have loud, powerful
                narratives. Instead, the absolute opposite has seemed to have occurred - the online environment can
                almost be viewed as a safer space for perpetrators, allowing them to attack women, LGBTIQA people, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not okay. This needs to change.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Africa’s particular voice and history in this dynamic needs to be a loud and powerful narrative that
                shifts the dominant white tide towards a different and more inclusive internet. <a href="#ref1"
                    title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                There have been so many terribly sad stories of rampant disregard for the lives and environment of
                Africa and Africans. We, as the users of, potential contributors to, and/or influencers of the internet
                (and online environment that is in its relative infancy in Africa), it is our responsibility to ensure
                that the narrative is one of inclusivity, enrichment, equality, truth and kindness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Africa is usually thought of a a <i>beneficiary</i> of technology, and never an <i>innovator</i> of it.
                Further, as Sheena mentions, the innovations in Africa are often thought of as only being in response to
                exiting problems on the continent - such as famine, drought, disease and death:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Technology in Africa is something that we use to change our lives, we do not innovate for fun, for
                pleasure and for play. This is a generalisation of course, but also, this is the dominant narrative you
                will find online. This is the danger of a single story that Chimamanda speaks of, where multiple truths
                are treated like water and forced to take the shape of the vessel they are poured into.<a href="#ref1"
                    title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The internet is as unequal as the world we live in. Only with the kindness and care that is required
                to understand and overcome the many real world problems, will we be able to change this. Sheena says it
                best:
            </p>
            <p class="BoldRed">
                "But for this to happen we need more African feminists taking up space, telling stories, giving
                alternative views, creating bodypositive content, showing off our bodies and talents and skills. African
                feminists make more room for African women online. " <a href="#ref1"
                    title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                At a time when the most vulnerable people are being asked to stay away from others, we are turning to an
                internet that is bigoted, racist, homophobic and classist for company and connections with a wider
                world.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Besides all the above pressing issues, in this time of the pandemic, people are being expected to be
                able to simply switch to online working - on connections and technology that they don't have. Without a
                feminist internet that ensures that all people can access and influence content and governance of this
                internet, we will be replicating the often violent and oppressive way of life that might eventually be
                inescapable <a href="#ref1" title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
                A feminist internet is more than just a gathering of like minds, it is also a call to action. It
                is a demand for diversity, and safety and fun. It is a big ask. But one gathering at a time, like the
                Making a Feminist Internet in Africa meeting, it is possible to begin to push for the same kinds of
                social, cultural, economic and political changes online that we demand offline/onground. In this global
                moment of crisis and isolation, the need for a feminist internet, one that includes and centres the
                voices of African feminists, is no longer necessary, it is crucial. <a href="#ref1"
                    title="Making a Feminist Internet in Africa">[1]</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This editorial by Sheena is an example of the crucial revolution that is (and needs to continue)
                happening around us in order to create this feminist internet. Sheena is a feminist with twelve years of
                working experience in Namibia, South Africa and Kenya with a background in media and communications. She
                is one of the many many many amazing influential, powerful African women that are making their voices
                heard in order to make real, positive change.

                    media platforms and brings to her activism a passion for music, art, travel, photography, fashion

                    <br><br>
                    Amina Doherty started to call herself feminist during undergraduate years when she found herself
                    lost in the writings of Chandra Mohanty, Gloria Anzaldúa, June Jordan. Amina was greatly inspired
                    when she made connections from their words with the life stories of her mother and her grandmother.
                    Over the years her interest in feminism has increased and revealed itself through different forms:
                    art exhibitions, community programmes, cultural events and grant-making initiatives. Now she is a
                    founding member and coordinator of FRIDA | The Young Feminist Fund, an organization that aims to
                    strengthen the capacity of young feminist organizations around the world through small grants. For
                    her feminism is ‘earth-based, heart-filled and spirit-centered.’ African feminism shows the
                    realities of women in different cultures of African countries. These women are quite brave to stand
                    up for political ethics and human rights, advocate for the revision of biased colonial-era laws,
                    intervene during armed conflict to protect the rights of civilians, challenge religious
                    fundamentalisms. It is resulted in some solid and important changes.

                <p class="story">
                    Shamillah is a Life Coach and Founder of Project Ignition established to provide young people with a
                    variety of opportunities to reach their greatest potential and grow into activists. Her
                    participation in the feminist movement is followed by the same aim – she wants to let more women
                    take part in different spheres of life, especially, in entrepreneurship. Working as a consultant on
                    females’ rights, HIV/AIDS and sexual rights helps her to achieve this goal.

                    Shamillah believes that feminism is not about the separation of personal and professional but it is
                    about the way you live your life.
