        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        I used flex display and some other cool things from this week's lecture, Thanks Lucky!!! :D
        <br><br>
        This week's blog post required me to look at the list of Tweets in the Theory Lecture Page. The one that grabbed
        my attention was this Tweet by <a
            href="https://twitter.com/Phxtho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1223931026184994817%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5500%2Fblogs%2F2020%2FWeek15%2FReflection-Fama-vs-Twitter%2F"

        The reason this grabbed my attention was actually due to the lack of engagement that the Tweet had. I thought
        that such an interesting topic would have more people talking about it, and yet this particular tweet have very
        little responses, retweets and/or likes. I decided to do more research.

        <h2>What is Fama.io?</h2>
        According to <a href="https://fama.io/" target="_blank">Fama.io</a> website, Fama is the smartest way to
        screen
        toxic workplace behaviour as it is a talent screening software that helps identify problematic behavior
        among potential hires and current employees by analyzing publicly available online information. Below are a
        few
        more descriptions taken directly from the <a href="https://fama.io/" target="_blank">Fama.io</a> website:

            <p class="EmphasisParagraph">
                <a class="EmphasisHeading">What Fama finds...</a>
                <br>
                Our machine learning technology has flagged hundreds of thousands of instances
                of misogyny, bigotry, racism, violence and criminal behavior in publicly available online content.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I am aware that the above points are directly from Fama itself, and thus only describe the positive points
            and advantages about their AI software. Further digging found some more interesting points about the AI
            software. According to First Advantage’s blog <a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>,
        <blockquote>
            “According to CareerBuilder, 60% of organizations are using public social media or online searching to
            screen job applicants in 2016. However, most of those companies do it manually.”
        </blockquote>
        Thus, one of the biggest advantages of using Fama instead of manual social media background checks, is that of
        saving time. If the check is done manually, it can take hours of someone’s time, while it will only take a few
        seconds for the Fama software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another advantage includes the fact that it requires significant effort for a human to accurately confirm an
            identity online since there’s often more than one individual with the same name <a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>, whereas Fama assures
            users that the software is programmed to always find the correct person. However, this became a point of
            contention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some companies wish to remove the liability from their Human Resources (HR) department by using Fama instead
            of asking the HR employees to perform manual Social Media background checks.
        <blockquote>
            “If you make a hire and it turns out they were posting sexist, racist and other lunacy online… that is not
            only a liability for an employer, it also calls into question your ability of making a hiring decision,”
            said Alex Granovsky, an employment lawyer in New York City <a href="#ref3"
                title="The tech that hiring managers are using to screen all of your social media posts">[3]</a>.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            “Without a standardized, automated process for accessing, viewing, evaluating, documenting and protecting
            social media data, organizations can quickly land in hot water. Here’s why: the same rules that apply to
            other forms of background checks – think: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) -, the EEOC – apply to social
            media screening” <a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>.
        </blockquote>
        It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a potential employee based on race, religion, sex,
        gender, national origin, age, disability, etc. Thus, in my opinion, if a company is trying to reduce the amount
        of discrimination within an internal hiring process, then the FIRST process should be to ensure that all
        members of the HR department are NOT racist, sexist or discriminatory in any way mentioned above, BEFORE using
        Fama.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, on the above point, I think that using software like Fama could definitely help reduce unconscious
            bias in the employment process. If an employer is manually performing the social media background check and
            accesses personal public information, this may cause unconscious biases made against the person. This is
            simply because you cannot "unsee" information. Pamela Daveta, a labour and employment law attornet with
            Seyfarth Shaw, LLC, USA, mentions that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) assumes that if
            you accessed the information, you used it in your employment decision<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>. This has landed a few HR employers
            in legal hot water.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also discovered that entire organizations can also land in hot legal waters:
        <blockquote>
            "Without a standardized, automated process for accessing, viewing, evaluating, documenting and protecting
            social media data, organizations can quickly land in hot water. Here’s why: the same rules that apply to
            other forms of background checks – think: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the EEOC – apply to social
            media screening<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>."
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fama CEO and co-founder Ben Mones said that employers aren’t that interested in recreational vices like
            alcohol use, but instead are focused on keeping bullies, misogynists and bigots out of their workplace. Fama
            even go as far as to have a case study about <a target="_blank"
                href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58d277cfe6f2e10bb3d0ea70/t/59026888e4fcb5f69db6eed6/1493330057120/Fama+Case+Study+-+Alcohol.pdf">
                Alcohol On An Entry-Level Job Candidate's Social Media</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fama has reported that while most of the screens are for potential hires, there has recently been a large
            increase in the number of companies running checks on current workers. Some people were now concerned that
            Fama would be used to enforce sexist/racist/etc. discriminatory views in a legal way. This is voiced by M.
            Cook, in their article <a href="https://notesfrombelow.org/article/a-basic-lack-of-understanding#">"A Basic
                Lack of Understanding":</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Whether or not AI is really useful, there’s no doubt that the belief that AI works is going to
            change our lives. For people who are already being exploited, AI will most likely be used to amplify this
            exploitation. For example, employers no longer need to snoop on the social media accounts of job applicants
            or employees; services like Fama use AI to automate this process, enabling mass surveillance of workers’
            online posts and flagging things that might assist in making hiring, firing, and promotion decisions. This
            forces workers to either moderate their entire online presence or make all interactions private. Even more
            importantly, though, services like this can be used to provide a veneer of impartial logic over prejudiced
            managerial decisions. By sending systems like Fama after employees the company already wish to dismiss or
            avoid hiring for illegal reasons (decisions based on race or gender, for example) it’s easy to find
            justifications that come from a computer - something perceived as impartial and rational <a href="#ref4"
                title="A Basic Lack of Understanding // Notes from Below">[4]</a>.
            <br><br>
            Even though we like to frame AI as making ‘decisions’ for companies, they lack many features that
            humans would have in the same position: algorithms can’t protest, have a change of heart, leak information,
            or make judgement calls. They simply do what they’re told, which makes their capacity to amplify power while
            simultaneously defending it from criticism extremely worrying.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a potential employee based on race, religion, sex,
            gender, national origin, age, disability, etc. and Fama claim to be very aware of this - their software is
            not able to allow any company to interact with any of these aforementioned classes of information. However,
            I believe the concern is not whether the software itself can be used in a racist/sexist/etc. way, but
            instead that it can be used to manually target a particular person. For example, a company could run the
            Fama software on only the woman candidates to ensure that 'dirt' is dug up on each of them, thus allowing
            the company to 'legitly' not hire any of these woman as apposed to the men candidates. Fortunately I am
            pretty sure this is illegal (as mentioned above) since the same rules that apply to other forms of
            background checks, apply to social media screening<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>. In other words, while this is a valid concern for
            candidates to have, it is not a valid criticism of Fama itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies using Fama are legally obligated to share the report with job candidates and employees to
            contest or explain the results <a href="#ref2"
                title="This company uses AI to flag racist and sexist comments from potential hires">[2]</a>, which
            counters the argument that many Twitter users have of being
            rejected by a company for ‘no apparent reason’. However, this 'obligation' of sharing the Fama report
            resulted in a very entertaining Twitter thread from @kmlefranc below.

            This entire Twitter thread made me chuckle, and also highlighted the main issue that I see with Fama being
            used as the only form of social media screening:
        </center>

        <p class="BoldRed">
            If the AI used by Fama is not artificially intelligent enough to pick up on the more subtle human
            emotions such as sarcasm... THEN WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU USE IT TO SCAN THROUGH <a>TWEETS</a> ON
            <span>TWITTER!?!</span>
            <br>(aka the human cesspit of sarcasm)
        </p>

        It was at this point in my research, as well as writing this blog, that I was about to conclude. I was going to
        say that I am "pro-Fama" if it is used in the correct way for the following reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Saves the business LOTS of time</li>
            <li>Takes the human-employee out of the screening process to prevent unconscious bias</li>
            <li>Appears to not allow businesses to search or even consider information such as race/sex/gender/etc.</li>
            <li>The fact that Fama is "focused on keeping bullies, misogynists and bigots out of their workplace" sounds
                pretty legit.</li>
            <li>Businesses must just ensure to read through the entire report to make sure that Twitter sarcasm (and
                other examples of human emotion that AI doesn't understand) are not used against the potential employee.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="BoldRed">
            But then...
            <br>
            I came accross a particular Fama.io blog...

            ...
            <br><br><br><br>
            THE FACT THAT BOARDS ARE FIRING EXECS AND TAKING BACK MONEY IS A GOOD FUCKING THING!!!???
            <br>
            <br> BECAUSE THESE EXECS ARE
            <span>DISCUSTING PIGS</span> THAT DESERVE TO GO TO JAIL??!!??!!
            <br>?!?<br>
            <br><br>
            Perhaps a better reason for prioritizing the prevention of sexual harassment in the work place could include
            the fact that sexual harassment inflicted by one person upon another person at ANY place (let alone the
            workplace) is immoral, unethical, illegal, disgusting, revolting, repulsive, sickening, nauseating,
            unsavoury, foul, outrageous, horrifying, monstrous, heinous, abhorrent, detestable, deplorable, inexcusable,
            etc. etc. etc.
            <br><br>
            Besides the fact that being sexually harassed can impact the psychological health, physical well-being and
            vocational development of the victim.
        </p>
        <p>I am concerned and no longer "pro-Fama".</p>
