            <h2>Foreword</h2>
            I used flex display and some other cool things from this week's lecture, Thanks Lucky!!! :D

            <p style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic; color:darkslategrey">
                P.S.
                <br>I had to remove the flex display because it was causing issues...
                <br>but now there's more issues with grid display...
                <br>sigh...
                <br>We continue to live and learn.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            This week's blog post required me to look at the list of Tweets in the Theory Lecture Page. The one that
            grabbed
            my attention was a tweet by user who said:
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://fama.io/" target="_blank">Fama.io</a> is further proof that AI doesn't have to be
                    smart
                    to be dangerous. Bad assumptions at scale
                </p>
                - Phatho (<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/Phxtho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1223931026184994817%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5500%2Fblogs%2F2020%2FWeek15%2FReflection-Fama-vs-Twitter%2F"

            </blockquote>
            The reason this grabbed my attention was actually due to the lack of engagement that the Tweet had. I
            thought that such an interesting topic would have more people talking about it, and yet this particular
            tweet have very little responses, retweets and/or likes. I decided to do more research.

            <h2>What is Fama.io?</h2>
            According to <a href="https://fama.io/" target="_blank">Fama.io</a> website, Fama is the smartest way to
            screen toxic workplace behaviour as it is a talent screening software that helps identify problematic
            behaviour among potential hires and current employees by analyzing publicly available online information.
            Below are a few
            more descriptions taken directly from the <a href="https://fama.io/" target="_blank">Fama.io</a> website:

                    Our technology helps businesses identify thousands of job-relevant behaviors,
                    such as racism or harassment, without exposing hiring managers to unnecessary risk or manual
                    work.

                    content.
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>
                I am aware that the above points are directly from Fama itself, and thus only describe the positive
                points
                and advantages about their AI software. Further digging found some more interesting points about the AI
                software. According to First Advantage’s blog <a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>,
            <blockquote>
                “According to CareerBuilder, 60% of organizations are using public social media or online searching to
                screen job applicants in 2016. However, most of those companies do it manually.”
            </blockquote>
            Thus, one of the biggest advantages of using Fama instead of manual social media background checks, is that
            of saving time. If the check is done manually, it can take hours of someone’s time, while it will only take
            a few seconds for the Fama software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another advantage includes the fact that it requires significant effort for a human to accurately
                confirm an identity online since there’s often more than one individual with the same name <a
                    href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>, whereas Fama assures
                users that the software is programmed to always find the correct person. However, this became a point of
                contention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies wish to remove the liability from their Human Resources (HR) department by using Fama
                instead of asking the HR employees to perform manual Social Media background checks.
            <blockquote>
                “If you make a hire and it turns out they were posting sexist, racist and other lunacy online… that is
                not only a liability for an employer, it also calls into question your ability of making a hiring
                decision,” said Alex Granovsky, an employment lawyer in New York City <a href="#ref3"
                    title="The tech that hiring managers are using to screen all of your social media posts">[3]</a>.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “Without a standardized, automated process for accessing, viewing, evaluating, documenting and
                protecting social media data, organizations can quickly land in hot water. Here’s why: the same rules
                that apply to other forms of background checks – think: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) -, the EEOC –
                apply to social media screening” <a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>.
            </blockquote>
            It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a potential employee based on race, religion, sex,
            gender, national origin, age, disability, etc. Thus, in my opinion, if a company is trying to reduce the
            amount of discrimination within an internal hiring process, then the FIRST process should be to ensure that
            all members of the HR department are NOT racist, sexist or discriminatory in any way mentioned above, BEFORE
            using Fama.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, on the above point, I think that using software like Fama could definitely help reduce
                unconscious bias in the employment process. If an employer is manually performing the social media
                background check and accesses personal public information, this may cause unconscious biases made
                against the person. This is simply because you cannot "unsee" information. Pamela Daveta, a labour and
                employment law attorney with Seyfarth Shaw, LLC, USA, mentions that the Equal Employment Opportunity
                Commission (EEOC) assumes that if you accessed the information, you used it in your employment
                decision<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>. This has landed a few HR employers
                in legal hot water.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also discovered that entire organizations can also land in hot legal waters:
            <blockquote>
                "Without a standardized, automated process for accessing, viewing, evaluating, documenting and
                protecting social media data, organizations can quickly land in hot water. Here’s why: the same rules
                that apply to other forms of background checks – think: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the EEOC –
                apply to social media screening<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>."
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fama CEO and co-founder Ben Mones said that employers aren’t that interested in recreational vices like
                alcohol use, but instead are focused on keeping bullies, misogynists and bigots out of their workplace.
                Fama even go as far as to have a case study about <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58d277cfe6f2e10bb3d0ea70/t/59026888e4fcb5f69db6eed6/1493330057120/Fama+Case+Study+-+Alcohol.pdf">
                    Alcohol On An Entry-Level Job Candidate's Social Media</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fama has reported that while most of the screens are for potential hires, there has recently been a
                large increase in the number of companies running checks on current workers. Some people were now
                concerned that Fama would be used to enforce sexist/racist/etc. discriminatory views in a legal way.
                This is voiced by M. Cook, in their article <a
                    href="https://notesfrombelow.org/article/a-basic-lack-of-understanding#">"A
                    Basic Lack of Understanding":</a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Whether or not AI is really useful, there’s no doubt that the belief that AI works is going to
                change our lives. For people who are already being exploited, AI will most likely be used to amplify
                this exploitation. For example, employers no longer need to snoop on the social media accounts of job
                applicants or employees; services like Fama use AI to automate this process, enabling mass surveillance
                of workers’ online posts and flagging things that might assist in making hiring, firing, and promotion
                decisions. This forces workers to either moderate their entire online presence or make all interactions
                private. Even more importantly, though, services like this can be used to provide a veneer of impartial
                logic over prejudiced managerial decisions. By sending systems like Fama after employees the company
                already wish to dismiss or avoid hiring for illegal reasons (decisions based on race or gender, for
                example) it’s easy to find justifications that come from a computer - something perceived as impartial
                and rational <a href="#ref4" title="A Basic Lack of Understanding // Notes from Below">[4]</a>.
                <br><br>
                Even though we like to frame AI as making ‘decisions’ for companies, they lack many features that
                humans would have in the same position: algorithms can’t protest, have a change of heart, leak
                information, or make judgement calls. They simply do what they’re told, which makes their capacity to
                amplify power while simultaneously defending it from criticism extremely worrying.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a potential employee based on race, religion, sex,
                gender, national origin, age, disability, etc. and Fama claim to be very aware of this - their software
                is not able to allow any company to interact with any of these aforementioned classes of information.
                However, I believe the concern is not whether the software itself can be used in a racist/sexist/etc.
                way, but instead that it can be used to manually target a particular person. For example, a company
                could run the Fama software on only the woman candidates to ensure that 'dirt' is dug up on each of
                them, thus allowing the company to 'legitly' not hire any of these woman as apposed to the men
                candidates. Fortunately I am pretty sure this is illegal (as mentioned above) since the same rules that
                apply to other forms of background checks, apply to social media screening<a href="#ref1" title="Is Social Media Screening Helping, or Hurting, Your Hiring
            Process?">[1]</a>. In other words, while this is a valid concern for
                candidates to have, it is not a valid criticism of Fama itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companies using Fama are legally obligated to share the report with job candidates and employees to
                contest or explain the results <a href="#ref2"
                    title="This company uses AI to flag racist and sexist comments from potential hires">[2]</a>, which
                counters the argument that many Twitter users have of being
                rejected by a company for ‘no apparent reason’. However, this 'obligation' of sharing the Fama report
                resulted in a very entertaining Twitter thread from user "bruise almighty" (<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/kmlefranc" target="_blank">@kmlefranc</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The first two Tweets give some background to the situation:
            <blockquote> I had to get a background check for my job, and it turns out the report
                is a 300+ page pdf of every single tweet I’ve ever liked with the work “fuck” in it.
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            The user then shares some images of the results of the report, shown below with the user's original

                The especially creepy part is this didn't turn up anything at all relevant or incriminating! I keep
                personal info on my non-public accounts. But their shitty algorithm means that my "reputation" and
                "character" is flagged as questionable and sent to my boss.

                This entire Twitter thread made me chuckle, and also highlighted the main issue that I see with Fama
                being used as the only form of social media screening:
            </p>

            <p class="BoldRed">
                If the AI used by Fama is not artificially intelligent enough to pick up on the more subtle human
                emotions such as sarcasm... THEN WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU USE IT TO SCAN THROUGH <a>TWEETS</a> ON
                <span>TWITTER!?!</span>
                <br>(aka the human cesspit of sarcasm)
            </p>

            It was at this point in my research, as well as writing this blog, that I was about to conclude. I was going
            to say that I am "pro-Fama" if it is used in the correct way for the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Saves the business LOTS of time</li>
                <li>Takes the human-employee out of the screening process to prevent unconscious bias</li>
                <li>Appears to not allow businesses to search or even consider information such as race/sex/gender/etc.
                </li>
                <li>The fact that Fama is "focused on keeping bullies, misogynists and bigots out of their workplace"
                    sounds pretty legit.</li>
                <li>Businesses must just ensure to read through the entire report to make sure that Twitter sarcasm (and
                    other examples of human emotion that AI doesn't understand) are not used against the potential
                    employee.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <br><br><br><br>
                THE FACT THAT BOARDS ARE FIRING EXECS AND TAKING BACK MONEY IS A GOOD FUCKING THING!!!???
                <br>
                <br> BECAUSE THESE EXECS ARE
                <span>DISCUSTING PIGS</span> THAT DESERVE TO GO TO JAIL??!!??!!
                <br>?!?<br>
                <br><br>
                Perhaps a better reason for prioritizing the prevention of sexual harassment in the work place could
                include the fact that sexual harassment inflicted by one person upon another person at ANY place (let
                alone the workplace) is immoral, unethical, illegal, disgusting, revolting, repulsive, sickening,
                nauseating, unsavoury, foul, outrageous, horrifying, monstrous, heinous, abhorrent, detestable,
                deplorable, inexcusable, etc. etc. etc.
                <br><br>
                Besides the fact that being sexually harassed can impact the psychological health, physical well-being
                and vocational development of the victim.
