        <h1>Using Google Cloud's Vision API</h1>
        <p>
            I must start with; I can't believe I got this to work...
        </p>
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>
            For this, the final exam submission, it is required that this website makes use of ONE external
            dependency or framework in order to explore the concept of augmenting, reflecting or challenging the
            physical world with the digital; specifically in context of the representation of Johannesburg. Since I
            suspected that implementing an interesting and useful dependency would take time and effort (I was correct),
            I also wanted to use a dependency that Eddie (my character) would actually be interested and
            inspired by as well. In other words, I really wanted this dependency to be something that Eddie would
            actually want in his life. Another important note is that Eddie's entire life is situated in Johannesburg.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first thought process was:
        <blockquote>
            When Eddie travels around Johannesburg...
            <br><b>How does he view his city?</b>
            <br>What does he see?
            <br>Does he want to know more?
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Eddie has been established as a person with a keen urge to learn. His second love is teaching and he has
            incorporated studying into most of his life. He holds a diploma in Mechanical Engineering and has studied
            further in other areas such as Theology and Social Studies. Over and above this, he lectured and taught
            mechanical drawing for years and years.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this in mind, my next thought, after watching the weekly lecture about APIs, was:
        <blockquote>
            Since Eddie LOVES learning...
            <br>What if he could learn more about his city no matter where he is?
        </blockquote>
        What if I could implement some dependency that allows the user to simply upload an image to this website, and it
        tells them more about the said image? Specifically where the image is of. After lots of research, I found the
        perfect dependency: Google's Cloud Vision API.
        </p>
        <h2>About the Vision API</h2>
        <p>
            According to Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs" target="_blank">documentation</a>,
            the Cloud Vision API allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within
            applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition
            (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, this API does EXACTLY what I need it to do! This was very exciting!
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements: Google Cloud Account</h3>
        <p>
            In order to use the API, Google requires that I have a Google Cloud account, with billing enabled and I was
            initially concerned about this as did not want to spend any money. Fortunately my concerns were unwarranted
            as a Google Cloud account has a few convenient features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                There is a free trial period in which the new account gets $300 to spend within a year.
            </li>
            <li>
                A credit card is required to start an account, but this will not be billed, even after the free trial
                period has ended.
                <ul>
                    <li>This is to prove your identity and authenticity to Google.</li>
                    <li>Projects are required to have billing setup before you can use many of the APIs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Every month, the Vision API allows the first 1000 units analysed PER feature free.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        See Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing" target="_blank">pricing page</a>
                        for more details.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        I thus was able to setup a Google Cloud account with sufficient access to use the Vision API without a hitch.
        Little did I know, this would be the least of my problems faced.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements: API Key</h3>
        <p>
            To use the API from my website, I had to create an API key that authenticates calls made to the Vision API.
            It took me SO long to figure out how this worked. I had spent so much time researching and learning about
            keys and attempting various solutions to no avail. I was honestly was about to give up, when I came accross
            the perfect example of how to do this in Google Cloud's own community
            <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.
            Specifically the <a
                href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/web-docs-samples/tree/master/vision/explore-api"
                target="_blank">GoogleCloudPlatform/web-docs-samples</a> repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I quickly realised that I had just done something very unsecure and rather dangerous: made my newly
            discovered and created API key public. This means that anyone with this key would be able to make calls to
            and use the Vision API... Not good!
        </p>
        <p>
            All research I did told me that hiding this key when using <b>only</b> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. was
            impossible. I was completely stuck. Fortunately, Google Cloud allows users to restrict their API keys to
            ONLY allow specified pages to call the API. While I am definitely not happy with this "solution", I believe
            it is the best that I can do for this assignment within the allocated time. As soon as this assignment has
            been marked I will remove the public API key.
        </p>
        <h3>External Dependency or Framework</h3>
        <p>
            Why is this dependency necessary?
            What alternatives are there?
            Why did I choose this one?
            Technical impact of it?
        </p>
