                This website will (hopefully) reflect the personality of my character - a sweet old man who is just
                trying to learn HTML. He likes wearing button-up Sportsman's Shirts:

                The colour scheme is appropriate for his age (and besides, his favourite colour is blue).
                <br>
                Sleek and straight lines will be used in the styling - with little to no frills or
                unnessesary decorations.
                <br>
                'Minimalistic' is the word of the day - simple, stylish and clean cut.

            <h2>Eddie's Story</h2>
            <p>
                My story began a long time ago in the small town of Pretoria (yes it was small back then). I
                went to the only school in town, and it is on this very school's bus where I first met
                the love of my life. Fast forward a few years, my parents didn’t have enough money to send
                me to
                university, however my father was adamant that I was to learn a trade – “Having a piece of
                paper with your name on it is nice, but if you have a trade, my boy, then you will always
                have work”
                was his philosophy on the subject. So, I went into the trade of instrument making, and for
                many
                years I made specialist instruments for all types of people – from doctors, to other
                craftsmen.
            </p>
            <p>
                As grateful as I am for getting the chance to work and learn such a skill, it become quite
                repetitive - I had a burning passion to learn something new. I started to look for work
                elsewhere;
                it was now that I discovered the second
                love of my life; teaching. I was fortunate enough to be hired as a part-time lecturer (I had
                been
                trained in technical drawing during my trade) by an institute that simultaneously
                allowed me to complete a mechanical engineering diploma. After this, I studied further in
                Theology –
                as I came from a very religious family – as well as Social Studies, however my true passion
                remained
                in teaching. It was then that I noticed a great need in my country – there were too many
                students,
                coming from previously (or currently at the time) disadvantaged backgrounds that did not
                possess the
                skills that the institute assumed they should have that were needed to pass (let alone
                excel) at the
                technical drawing course (or any other course that requires 3D visualization skills). I then
                created
                my third love – a one-year bridging course for such students, that would allow them to catch
                up the
                missing skills in minimal time, and thus further their studies with better pass rates and
                grades. I
                headed this program for many years, until being asked to pass it on to another, younger
                lecturer. I
                continued to lecture at the institute until retiring only six years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is because of this passion for teaching and learning that I created this website – with
                the hopes
                to inspire just one other person to go and read a ‘something’, a ‘anything’.
                <br>Reading will opens the mind!
