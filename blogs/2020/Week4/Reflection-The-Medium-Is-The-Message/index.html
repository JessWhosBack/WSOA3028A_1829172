            <blockquote><i>
                    “This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium / that
                    is,
                    of any extension of ourselves / result from the new scale that is introduced into our
                    affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology” - Marshall McLuhan
                </i></blockquote>
            <br>

            The language that Marshall McLuhan uses to explain the concept is repetitive and painful to read,
            and I know I will have to read it a few more times to fully understand it.
            From what I could gather from Marshall McLuhan’s <i>The Medium is the Message</i>, it seems as
            if many people
            misunderstand (or at least misquote) the lesson that he is trying to teach. People try
            to put two and two together to conclude that, in terms of importance, the channel supersedes the
            context. I think instead the medium always announces an apparent 'truth'
            <b>(and whether or not that 'truth' is actually true is another story)</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example would be that of photography versus art – if someone were to show you a photograph and a
                drawing of the same scenario, but with different aspects included, which would you believe to be the
                true reflection of reality? A few years ago, one would surely say with confidence that the
                photograph has to be real version. This simple example shows how the medium can add it’s own truth
                to the message contained within it.
                <br>
                <center>
                    <i><b>“Pics or it didn’t happen”</b> - Everyone at some point</i>
                </center>
                <br>
                Today we know that photographs can be edited, and so disbelief towards the absolute certainty in
                photographs is slowly becoming a new message as society fights against all things fake or false.
                This then
                continues in McLuhan’s message when he says that “it is only too typical that that “content” of any
                medium blinds us to the character of the medium.” I think ask time continues, and more 'new media'
                is produced and invented, the message in 'old media' will change.
