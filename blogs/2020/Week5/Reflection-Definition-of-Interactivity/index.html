                This is a reflection based, first, on part of the lecture “Interaction and the www” from Interactive
                Media IIIA (WSOA3028) and, finally, on further research and readings.

                        Aaron Smuts
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Aaron Smuts, Associate Professor and chair of the Department of Philosophy at Rhode Island
                        College
                        <a href="#ref1" title="Lev Manovich - About Lev Manovich">[1]</a>,
                        believes that the term “interactive” should be considered a “general-purpose term that
                        indicates something about whatever it is applied to, whether that is art, artefact, or
                        nature”. He bases his definition in the notion of “interacting with” something. In Aaron’s
                        paper, “What is interactivity” <a href="#ref2" title="What is Interactivity?">[2]</a>, he
                        develops his theory of interactivity as mutual responsiveness and states that something is
                        interactive if and only if it:

                            <li>Is not completely controlled</li>
                            <li>Does not respond in a completely random fashion</li>

                        Lev Manovich
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Lev Manovich <a href="#ref3" title="Lev Manovich - About Lev Manovich">[3]</a>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Presidential Professor, The Graduate Center, City University of New York</li>
                            <li>Founder and Director of the Cultural Analytics Lab</li>
                            <li>Member of the PhD Program in Computer Science, MS Program in Data Analysis and
                                Visualization and MA Program in Digital Humanities</li>
                        </ul>
                        In his book, “The Language of New Media” <a href="#ref4"
                            title="The Language of New Media">[4]</a>, Lev states that “as with digital, I
                        avoid using the world interactive in this book without qualifying it, for the same reason – I
                        find the concept to be too broad to be truly useful… Once an object is represented in a
                        computer, it automatically becomes interactive. Therefore, to call computer media ‘interactive’
                        is meaningless – it simply means stating the most basic fact about computers” <a href="#ref4"
                            title="The Language of New Media">[4]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He also proposes that interactivity is an illusion because the choices that a user can
                        interact with have already been programmed into the “interactable” object by a designer. Thus,
                        an experience seems interactive because the user is given a choice, but in reality the user is
                        only following one of the designers preconceived paths through a branching tree structure. <a
                            href="#ref4" title="The Language of New Media">[4]</a>
                        Lev calls the concept of true interactivity in new media “teleacton” or “action from a
                        distance” and this can only come from an object that can be influenced in real time.

                        Espen Aarseth

                    <p>
                        Espen Aarseth, Professor and Head of Center at the Center for Computer Games Research at the
                        IT University of Copenhagen. An extract from his book “We All Want to Change the World”
                        <a href="#ref5" title="We All Want to Change the World">[5]</a>
                        goes:
                        <blockquote>
                            <i>
                                Rather than hiding some obscure theoretical meaning beneath the computer
                                salesman rhetoric, “interactive” has two relatively clear connotations. First,
                                it means computerized, digital, online, etc. Replace any occurrence of
                                “interactive” with “digital,” and the meaning of the sentence changes very
                                little, if at all. The other connotation, following the batch/interactive
                                evolution, is “better.” Implicitly in most uses of the word is the idea that the
                                “interactive” object is simply better than its “noninteractive” counterpart.
                            </i>
                        </blockquote>
                        He further mentions that he tries to refrain from using the word ‘interactive’, preferring
                        instead to use the term ‘ergodic’. He defines ‘ergodic’ literature as texts where,
                        “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text” <a href="#ref5"
                            title="We All Want to Change the World">[5]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the question of “what is nontrivial” is not an easy one to answer. As explored in
                        the lecture, Gonzalo Frasca expands on the definition of “nontrivial” as “active
                        participations – like clicking or typing – rather than traditional actions associated with
                        reading – like turning pages – which does not modify the shape of the text itself”.

                    <p>
                        Hanli Geyser, Lecturer in Game Design at the University of Witwatersrand (Head of Department
                        of Digital Arts from 2015-2019), decided to “butcher” these various definitions for us, her
                        students. Her definition is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something is interactive if it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is responsive</li>
                            <li>Does not respond in a completely random fashion</li>
                            <li>Requires non trivial effort</li>
                            <li>Which, in some way, modifies the shape of the text itself</li>
                        </ul>
                        She further explains that it is important to have a working definition for this course
                        (Interactive Media 3A) but it is also just as important to keep trying to make our own
                        personal
                        working definitions.

                <h2>My Working Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I don’t know. There’s so much information....
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the most difficult part of a definition for “interactive” relies on the fact that the
                    words within the definition have so many difficulties in their own definitions. Mainly, the word
                    “nontrivial”. If my sister picks up my phone, she is able to navigate and interact with
                    it without any problems. In fact if my 3 year old cousin picks up my phone, he can also navigate
                    and interact with it without any problems. However, my grandmother cannot even get the screen to
                    turn on, let alone tap on the icons to open or navigate an application. This demonstrates how
                    “trivial” things differ from person to person, and thus how easily “nontrivial” things can
                    differ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I agree with Smuts about how for an object to be considered interactive, it should not respond
                    in a completely random fashion – if there was no possible way to get the required output
                    relatively reliable, or to even predict what a required output could be, then this defeats the
                    purpose of interacting with the object in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I disagree that if the object is in full control of the user, then it is considered not
                    interactive. While this touches on Manovich’s idea that interactivity is an illusion, I think
                    the word “interactive” is too broad to even start considering whether it is an illusion or not.
                    In other words, I don’t think it matters whether the “interactive-ness” is an illusion or not, I
                    think the object is still interactive, even if it unknowingly controls where you are going (if
                    you are aware that you have no control, then this is not interactive). For example; in games,
                    the user gets a sense of interactivity, but the ending of the game is scripted. I don’t think
                    this sense can be in any way discredited but should perhaps be described differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a false sense of interactivity is not considered interactive, then arguably, anything digital
                    is not truly interactive, which is obviously problematic. Again, I think we simply need a new
                    word for “interactivity in which the outcome is controlled/out of our control”. Perhaps
                    “predetermined interactivity” could work as a substitute to provide clarity. Along this same
                    tangent, if the user can completely control the object, I think this is still interactive so long as
                    the object gives some sort of feedback. If it does not give feedback, then I agree that it is not
                    interactive. This leans on Smut’s points 1 and 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point I definitely think my definition of “interactive” is too narrow as it does not
                    require the text/object to be modified. According to Frasca and Aarseth, if something is
                    “interactive” then it will modify the shape of the text itself through some nontrivial effort. I
                    think Hanli’s definition encompasses everything that is needed for this course (Interactive
                    Media 3A). I really like and thoroughly understand the way she described the different
                    aspects of the word in her definition. I will thus be using Hanli’s definition throughout this
                    course unless I am able to flesh out my definition more – i.e. until it becomes a better worked
                    example that I am more confident in and sure of.
