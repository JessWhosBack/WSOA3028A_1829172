            Hi, my name is Eddie. It is wonderful to make your acquaintance! Welcome to my website! I am very proud of it. 
            I love learning new things more than anything and how-to-make-a-website is my latest quest for knowledge. 
            <br> <br>
            I am 79 years of age and so my life story is rather extensive, but not even close to over! 
            Not only will I share a bit about myself here, but I will also post weekly blogs in which I will share anything and everything new that I learn.
        </p>
